# iOS Directory Guidelines

**Objective:** Prevent the creation of duplicate files or directories within the `ios` project structure.

## Core Principles

1.  **Verify Existence Before Creation/Modification:** Before creating a new file or modifying an existing one within the `ios` directory, ALWAYS verify if a file with the same name and purpose already exists in the target location or elsewhere within the `ios` structure. Use file search or directory listing tools if unsure.

2.  **Audit Directory Structure:** Before adding new files or directories, thoroughly review the relevant parts of the existing `ios` directory structure. Understand the current organization to ensure your changes fit logically and don't introduce redundancy.

## Procedures

-   **When asked to create a new file (e.g., `MyNewClass.swift` in `ios/ProjectName/Sources/`):**
    1.  Check if `ios/ProjectName/Sources/MyNewClass.swift` already exists.
    2.  Check if a similar class/file exists elsewhere in `ios/` that might serve the same purpose.
    3.  If no duplicates are found, proceed with creation.

-   **When asked to add a new directory (e.g., `ios/ProjectName/Resources/NewResources/`):**
    1.  Check if `ios/ProjectName/Resources/NewResources/` already exists.
    2.  Review the contents of `ios/ProjectName/Resources/` to ensure `NewResources` is an appropriate and non-redundant addition.
    3.  If no duplicates are found and the structure is sound, proceed with creation.

-   **When asked to modify a file:**
    1.  Confirm the target file path is correct and the file exists.
    2.  Briefly review the file's context within its directory to ensure the modification is appropriate for that specific file.

By consistently applying these checks, we can maintain a clean and accurate `ios` directory structure.
