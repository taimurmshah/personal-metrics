## 3. Frontend Tasks (React Native for iOS)
    *   **Problem:** Initial plan was to use native iOS (Swift) for the frontend.
        *   **Attempt 1:** User initially preferred Swift for iOS development.
        *   **Solution:** Decision made to switch frontend development from native iOS (Swift) to React Native. The `implementation-plan-v1.md` and `MVP_PRD.md` have been updated to reflect this change. This impacts all subsequent frontend tasks, which will now be implemented using React Native.

*   [ ] Set up React Native Project (targeting iOS initially).
*   [ ] Write tests for Google Sign-In flow initiation (TDD, using React Native testing library and a Google Sign-In mock) - Ref: FR1, FR2
*   [x] Implement Google Sign-In button and initiate OAuth flow (using a React Native Google Sign-In library) - Ref: FR1, FR2
    *   **Problem:** The initial implementation used a generic `Button` and lacked a loading state during the asynchronous sign-in process.
        *   **Attempt 1:** Basic implementation with a generic `Button` and direct calls to `GoogleSignin.signIn()`.
        *   **Solution:** Replaced the generic `Button` with `GoogleSigninButton` from `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` for standard branding. Added a `isLoading` state to the `AuthScreen` component, which is set to `true` before initiating sign-in and `false` in a `finally` block. An `ActivityIndicator` is shown while `isLoading` is `true`, and the `GoogleSigninButton` is disabled to prevent multiple presses. This enhances user experience by providing visual feedback.
*   [x] Write tests for handling Google Sign-In response and sending to backend (TDD) - Ref: FR3
    *   **Problem:** Deciding on the HTTP client for frontend to backend communication.
        *   **Attempt 1:** Initial tests were written using `fetch` API.
        *   **Solution:** User preference is to use `axios` where sensible. Updated `authService.test.ts` to use `axios` and its mocking. Added preference to `learned-memories.mdc` and noted in `technical_architecture.md`.
*   [ ] Implement handling of Google Sign-In response and communication with backend auth - Ref: FR3, FR4
*   [ ] Write tests for secure API token storage (e.g., AsyncStorage or a secure storage library for React Native) (TDD) - Ref: FR5, NF3
    *   **Problem:** Need to define and write tests for storing, retrieving, and removing an API token.
        *   **Attempt 1:** Decided to mock `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for testing `saveToken`, `getToken`, and `removeToken` functions to be defined in `src/utils/storage.ts`.
        *   **Solution:** Proposed the initial test suite in `src/utils/storage.test.ts`, including tests for successful operations and error handling according to `error-logging-guidelines.mdc`.
*   [ ] Implement secure API token storage - Ref: FR5, NF3
    *   **Problem:** Need to implement the `saveToken`, `getToken`, and `removeToken` functions in `src/utils/storage.ts` to pass the previously written tests.
        *   **Attempt 1:** Implemented the functions using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.
        *   **Solution:** Created `src/utils/storage.ts` with `saveToken`, `getToken`, `removeToken`, and `TOKEN_KEY`. Error handling follows `error-logging-guidelines.mdc`, logging structured JSON and re-throwing errors. This implementation should satisfy the tests in `src/utils/storage.test.ts`.
*   [ ] Write tests for Timer UI component state transitions (Initial -> Running -> Paused -> Resumed -> Stopped -> Initial) (TDD, using React Native testing library) - Ref: FR7-FR12
    *   **Problem:** Define and write tests for the Timer UI component's state machine (Initial, Running, Paused, Resumed, Stopped).
        *   **Attempt 1:** Created a placeholder `src/components/Timer.tsx` to facilitate test writing. This component includes basic state management for `timerState` and `timeDisplay`, and renders conditional buttons (Start, Pause, Resume, Stop) based on the state.
        *   **Solution:** The existing placeholder `src/components/Timer.tsx` was reviewed and confirmed to meet the UI requirements for this task. It correctly initializes the time display to "00:00:00" and conditionally renders the Start, Pause, Resume, and Stop buttons based on its internal `timerState`. This implementation is expected to pass the UI state transition tests in `src/components/__tests__/Timer.test.tsx` once environment/linter issues are resolved. The actual timer counting logic is deferred to a subsequent task.
*   [ ] Implement Timer UI component (display `00:00:00`, Start/Pause/Resume/Stop buttons) - Ref: FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12
    *   **Problem:** Ensure the `Timer.tsx` component correctly displays the initial time and the required Start/Pause/Resume/Stop buttons as per its state, to pass the previously written UI state transition tests.
        *   **Solution:** The existing placeholder `src/components/Timer.tsx` was reviewed and confirmed to meet the UI requirements for this task. It correctly initializes the time display to "00:00:00" and conditionally renders the Start, Pause, Resume, and Stop buttons based on its internal `timerState`. This implementation is expected to pass the UI state transition tests in `src/components/__tests__/Timer.test.tsx` once environment/linter issues are resolved. The actual timer counting logic is deferred to a subsequent task.
*   [ ] Write tests for timer logic (start, pause, resume, stop, time calculation, likely within a custom hook or component state) (TDD) - Ref: FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12
    *   **Problem:** Define and write tests for the core timer logic (start, pause, resume, stop, time increment) to be encapsulated in a custom hook `useTimer`.
        *   **Attempt 1 (Decision):** Decided to implement timer logic in a custom hook `useTimer` for better separation of concerns and testability, as per best practices.
        *   **Attempt 2 (Test Creation):** Created `src/hooks/__tests__/useTimer.test.ts`. This test suite uses `@testing-library/react`'s `renderHook` and `act`, along with `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` (from Vitest, as per `testing-guidelines.mdc`) to test the hook's lifecycle. Tests cover:
            *   Initial state (seconds, isRunning, isPaused).
            *   `start()`: sets `isRunning` to true, time increments.
            *   `pause()`: sets `isPaused` to true, `isRunning` to false, time stops.
            *   `resume()`: sets `isRunning` to true, `isPaused` to false, time continues.
            *   `stop()`: resets state, calls an `onStopCallback` with elapsed duration.
            *   Edge cases like calling actions in inappropriate states (e.g., pause when not running) or starting when already running.
        *   **Solution (Test Suite):** The comprehensive test suite in `src/hooks/__tests__/useTimer.test.ts` was created. Linter errors related to missing modules/types were noted, expected to be resolved by environment setup and the subsequent creation of `useTimer.ts`.
        *   **Attempt 3 (Hook Skeleton):** Created a skeleton `src/hooks/useTimer.ts` file. This file defines the `UseTimerReturn` interface and the basic hook structure with `useState` for `seconds`, `isRunning`, `isPaused`, `useRef` for `intervalRef`, `startTimeRef`, `accumulatedSecondsRef`, and placeholder `useCallback` functions for `start`, `pause`, `resume`, and `stop`. This structure is intended to allow the test file to resolve its import and type-check, pending actual logic implementation.
*   [ ] Implement timer logic (custom hook or component state management) - Ref: FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12
    *   **Problem:** Implement the timer logic within the `useTimer` custom hook to pass the tests in `src/hooks/__tests__/useTimer.test.ts`.
        *   **Solution:** Implemented the `useTimer` hook in `src/hooks/useTimer.ts`. The implementation includes:
            *   State variables: `seconds` (for display), `isRunning`, `isPaused`.
            *   Refs: `intervalRef` (for `setInterval` ID), `segmentStartTimeRef` (to track start of a running segment), `accumulatedSecondsRef` (to store time from previous segments before a pause).
            *   `start()` function: Resets times, sets `isRunning` to true, `isPaused` to false, and starts an interval to update `seconds` every 1000ms based on `Date.now()` and `segmentStartTimeRef`.
            *   `pause()` function: Clears interval, sets `isRunning` to false, `isPaused` to true. Calculates elapsed time for the current segment and adds it to `accumulatedSecondsRef`. Updates `seconds` display to this accumulated value.
            *   `resume()` function: Sets `isRunning` to true, `isPaused` to false. Resets `segmentStartTimeRef` and starts a new interval, adding current segment time to `accumulatedSecondsRef` for display.
            *   `stop()` function: Clears interval, resets all states (`isRunning`, `isPaused`, `seconds` to 0, refs). Calculates final total duration (including current running segment if any) and calls the optional `onStopCallback` with this duration if it's greater than 0.
            *   `useEffect` for cleanup: Clears the interval if the component unmounts.
            *   Functions are memoized with `useCallback` and include guards against inappropriate state transitions (e.g., starting if already running).
            *   This implementation is designed to satisfy all test cases in `src/hooks/__tests__/useTimer.test.ts` once environment issues are resolved.
*   [ ] Write tests for sending session data to backend API on Stop (TDD, mocking the API call) - Ref: FR12, FR14
*   [ ] Implement API call to `POST /api/sessions` on Stop (using fetch or a library like Axios) - Ref: FR12, FR14
*   [ ] Implement handling of API responses (success/error) and UI reset - Ref: FR12, NF5
    *   **Problem:** Need to provide explicit user feedback (success/failure) when saving a meditation session.
        *   **Attempt 1 (Discussion):** Considered returning a status from `handleStop` in `useTimer`.
        *   **Attempt 2 (Discussion):** Considered if current UI reset and console logging were sufficient for MVP.
        *   **Attempt 3 (Chosen):** Decided to add a new state `saveStatus: 'idle' | 'saving' | 'success' | 'error'` to the `useTimer` hook.
        *   **Solution:** Modified `useTimer.ts` to include the `saveStatus` state, logic to update it during the API call in `handleStop`, and a mechanism to reset it to 'idle' after a brief period for displaying messages. This status will be consumed by UI components for user feedback.

## 4. Local Testing Tasks

*   [ ] Test Google Sign-In flow end-to-end (React Native iOS -> Backend -> `Supabase`).
    *   **Problem:** The initial implementation plan lacked specific steps on *how* to perform the end-to-end test for Google Sign-In, and the user is new to React Native.
        *   **Attempt 1:** AI performed a web search for "how to test react native google sign in end-to-end manually".
        *   **Solution:** Based on general testing principles for such flows and React Native context, a detailed 6-step manual verification process (Prerequisites, Client-Side Actions & Observations, Backend API Log Checks, Supabase DB Checks, Client-Side Token Storage/UI Update, and optional Negative Cases) was formulated and added to the `implementation-plan-v1.md` under this task. This provides a clear guide for manual E2E testing of the Google Sign-In feature.
*   [ ] Test session recording flow (Start -> Pause -> Resume -> Stop -> Verify data in `Supabase`).
*   [ ] Test handling of network errors during session save.
*   [ ] Verify RLS policies prevent cross-user data access.
*   [ ] Perform UI testing on target iOS versions/devices.
*   [ ] Monitor `Vercel` logs and `Supabase` usage.
*   [ ] Prepare for App Store submission (icons, descriptions, etc. - may be post-MVP).
